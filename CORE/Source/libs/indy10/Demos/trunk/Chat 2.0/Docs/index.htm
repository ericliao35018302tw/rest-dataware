  <Center><h1>Indy 10 Chat Demo (Server)</h1>
  Origional Developer: Jeremy Darling<br>
  Release Date: September 10th, 2003</center><br>

  This is the new Indy Chat Server for Indy 10.0b. It comes compiled with a client
  and has been tested under Delphi 5.0. This is a complete rewrite of the older
  version of the chat system that I did for Indy 9.0 and 8.0. This version is based
  on my Demo Base Server and would be an easy starting point for someone to write
  an actual chat system off of. User checking is currently not implemented and
  duplicate name checking is not implemented. This is left as an exercise for those
  of you whom have interest in it. The code is commented and as I get more
  documentation will be updated with more comments and files. So watch the Indy 10
  Demos distribution for new versions. If you want to see what I have done with this
  demo without having to wait then you can always try downloading it from:

  <br>
  I have no illusions that this code is bug free.  If you find something let me
  know about it and I will get the fix into the version I send to the Demos Team.<br>
  <br>
  Thanks,<br>
