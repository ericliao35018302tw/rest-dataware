Steps to Successfully install and run an SSL Server in Indy 10.1.3

First open a browser and navigate to: http://www.intelicom.si/
  Select your language at the top of the page (EN for english)
  Select downloads
  Select "Indy OpenSSL"
  Extract the Zip file that you just downloaded to your project
  folder (in the case of the demos this is the Bin folder)

Navigate to http://www.arcanatech.com/
  Find the products page
  Their should be a listing either SSL Tools or SSL Buddy
  Download SSL Buddy and install it

Start SSL Buddy
  Click Start SSL Buddy
  Select "Generate and Self-Sign a certificate"
  Click Start
  Follow the On Screen Directions VERY CLOSLY
  If you are going to use this for localhost then make sure that you
    use localhost, if its for a website make sure you use the
	website URL (EX: eonclash.com) failure to do so will result in
	an invalid certificate.
  Set the export key file location to your application folder
  This will generate the certificate and bring you back to the main
    screen where you started out.
  Now select "Prepare an SSL certificate for installation in an
    Indy/IntraWeb Server."
  
  Click start, then next
  Select that you created it with SSL Buddy then Next
  Select the key file (<URL>.reg file) in your application root
    folder that you generated above.  In the case of using
	localhost the file is named: localhost.key
  The export path should fill in automatically for you, if not
    then fill it in as your default application folder
  The last line enter the common name, IE: Localhost, eonclash.com
    ect...
  You will get a window asking you to paste your certificate file
    below, it should already be filled in for you, simply click
	next
  For the existing password use the e-mail address you entered
    as the administrative e-mail.
  Follow the directions on the SSL Buddy screen.  Your certificate
    won't appear, simply click import, locate the certificate file
	and import it into the trusted.  Then move down the list given
	on the screen.  Its imparative that you follow the directions
	too the letter.
  Place the exported root.pem key file into your application folder
  Close SSL Buddy
  
  Open and compile the SSL HTTP Server Demo application located
    in the folder with this file.
  Set the following paramaters up on the SSL Setup Page:
      Certificate File: <URL>.cer (or <URL>.crt)
	  Key File: key.pem
	  Password: <The new password used from above>
  Unfortunately I have no idea what Root Certificate File or
    Cipher List are used for.  Nothing in the help files, so
	just to get this far was a set of educated guesses.
	
Of special NOTE:
  For some reason when I use this method everything works fine,
  but I do get an error while running in the debugger I do get
  an assertion failure on line 703:(IdCustomHTTPServer.pas)
  Source:
    Assert(not IOHandler.ReadLnTimedOut);
  But everything runs fine.  Connecting to my new SSL Server
  at http://localhost/ results in me being asked to verify that
  I want to use "Their/My" certificate and once accepted I can
  browse w/o any problems.
  
  
Anyways, thats the documentation to go with this demo.  I know
its not much, but hopefully its enough to get you up and running.
