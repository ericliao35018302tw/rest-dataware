  <Center><h1>Indy Demo Base (Server)</h1>
  Origional Developer: Jeremy Darling<br>
  Release Date: September 10th, 2003</center><br>

  This is a conversion of the Indy 9.x base server to Indy 10.0b and has all of
  the same features as well as some new ones.  This basic layout should be sufficient
  for any server project.  To modify this to run with one of the other server
  components simply remove "Server" from the project main form (frmMain) and place
  your new server component on it, then name this component "Server".  Their are
  spots in the code for adding in features and a basic client connection object is
  provided for your convienence.<br><br>
  <b>New Features</b> (please look at code for better understanding)<b>:</b><br>

        Log procedure added.<br>
        Process Log is now color coded.<br>
        Single button start and stop.<br>
        Many more read the comments in the code for more information.

  I have no illusions that this code is bug free.  If you find something let me
  know about it and I will get the fix into the version I send to the Demos Team.<br>

  Thanks,<br>
